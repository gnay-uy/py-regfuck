# py-regfuck
my regfuck implementation in python

i don't know if the damage parameter actually affects anything, but i can assure you that your pc will never boot again after running this

please don't run this on your host pc

**i am not responsible** for any damage caused btw, **educational purposes** only!


# how to use
1. ensure u have admin
2. add to the end of the code `regfuck(winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, damage)` (change "LOCAL_MACHINE" to whatever hive u want, and "damage" to any integer between 1-100 (dont be a wuss go for 80-100))
3. cmd.exe, run as admin, (file name).py
4. good luck repairing it
